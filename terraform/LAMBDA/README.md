# Project1 Lambda

These Terraform files will use AWS CloudWatch service to trigger AWS Lambda to stop and start Amazon EC2 instances at regular intervals.   

This establishes the following:

- An IAM policy attached to a role for the Lambda service 
- Lambda functions that stop and start the EC2 instances (a bastion and two web servers tagged AutoOnOff). The runtime is Python 2.7
- Rules that trigger the Lambda functions. The instances are started at 8pm Mon-Fri. The instances are stopped at 8am Mon-Fri
- Rule association with the Lambda functions
- AWS Lambda Permissions allowing CloudWatch to execute the Lambda functions
